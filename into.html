    <P align="justify">Roopesh Shetty started his career as a YouTuber where he started uploading Tulu comedy album songs. He then worked as an RJ and VJ in Mangaluru. He made his film debut in a supporting role in Dibbana Tulu movie. In 2015, he appeared as the main lead in Ice Cream Tulu movie. However, the movie did not do well at the box-office. He then made his Kannada debut with Danger Zone. This film also failed to reach maximum audiences. After appearing in several Kannada and Tulu films, his luck has been changed after the release of Girgit Tulu movie.[9] Along with acting, he also directed that movie along with Rakesh Kadri. He also made Gamjaal Tulu Movie in 2021 which recovered its budget in the first three days of release.[10] In September 2022 he emerged as the winner of the Season 1 of Bigg Boss Kannada OTT.</P>
